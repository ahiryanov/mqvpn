 * Populated from PATH_LABEL capsules the client announces at path
 * (re)activation; path_id is volatile (updated on every announcement).
 * weight/dscp_mask is either the value the CLIENT itself announced (the
 * default — this is what lets "set it once on the client" take effect on
 * the server's downlink too, with no separate server-side action) or an
 * operator's explicit mqvpn_server_set_path_weight_by_iface() /
 * _dscp_mask_by_iface() call, which always wins from then on
 * (weight_from_operator / dscp_mask_from_operator) — an operator override
 * is a more specific, intentional action than the client's own default,
 * and must not be silently clobbered by the client's next reconnect
 * re-announcing its own (unchanged) value. Either source's value is
 * reapplied automatically whenever path_id changes.
 *
 * The "client's own default" half above is itself gated by
 * s->config.sync_path_labels (mqvpn_config_set_sync_path_labels(), default
 * on) — when off, only an operator's explicit call ever populates
 * has_weight/has_dscp_mask, so client and server tune independently.
 *
 * weight_from_operator / dscp_mask_from_operator additionally mark a value
 * as eligible for the REVERSE trip: svr_push_path_label_to_client() pushes
 * exactly these (never a client-adopted value) back down to the client
 * over MQVPN_CAPSULE_PATH_LABEL_PUSH, gated by s->config.push_path_labels
 * (mqvpn_config_set_push_path_labels(), default off) — see
 * mqvpn_path_label.h's "Problem 3".

/* ─── Server-side per-path weight/DSCP-mask (wrtt/wrr/dscp downlink) ───
 *
 * Client-side path assignment (mqvpn_client_set_path_weight/dscp_mask) only
 * ever affects packets the CLIENT sends — QUIC multipath scheduling is
 * per-endpoint-per-direction, so on its own it has no effect on which path
 * the SERVER picks for the downlink bytes it sends back. BUT the client
 * also reports its own weight/dscp_mask to the server via the PATH_LABEL
 * capsule (see mqvpn_path_label.h and svr_path_label_t's doc comment), and
 * the server ADOPTS that report for its own downlink scheduling by
 * default — so calling the client-side setter alone is normally enough
 * for both directions to agree, no server-side call required. That
 * adoption can be disabled server-wide with
 * mqvpn_config_set_sync_path_labels(cfg, 0), for operators who want the
 * client and server tuned fully independently; the functions below are
 * then the only way to set a server-side value.
 *
 * The functions below are for PINNING the server to a value different
 * from what the client reports (asymmetric control) — an explicit call
 * here always wins over the client's report, from then on. The plain
 * path_id form is keyed by (user, path_id) — a server has no local-
 * interface concept for a path, only the QUIC path_id it shares with the
 * client (already surfaced per-user in mqvpn_server_get_client_info's
 * per-path output) — and does NOT persist across a full path teardown/
 * recreate: path_id can change, and there is no local slot to re-apply
 * from. The _by_iface variants further below DO persist across that (and
 * are what the client's own auto-reported value uses internally), by
 * keying on the iface name the client announces per path instead of the
 * volatile path_id directly — same iface string the client already uses
 * everywhere else (mqvpn_path_desc_t.iface, the client's set_path_weight
 * control command). Prefer these over the plain path_id form unless you
 * specifically want a one-shot, non-persistent override. */
