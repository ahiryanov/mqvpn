mqvpn is an open-source VPN that combines multiple internet connections—such as Wi-Fi, cellular, Starlink, and multiple ISPs—for bandwidth aggregation and seamless failover.

Example: an 8 Mbps SRT live stream over two 6 Mbit uplinks — a single connection (left) vs the same two connections bonded by mqvpn (right):

## Features

- **Multipath** — Bind multiple interfaces (WiFi + LTE, dual ISP). Seamless failover and bandwidth aggregation via WLB or WRTT scheduler.
- **Standards-based** — the tunnel is MASQUE CONNECT-IP (RFC 9484) over Multipath QUIC. Optional extensions (hybrid TCP lane, reorder) are negotiated in-band; the wire stays standard when they are off.
- **Dual-stack** — IPv4 + IPv6 inside the tunnel.
- **Multi-Platform** — Available on Linux (server/client), Windows (client only), macOS (client only) and Android (client only) support.
- **PSK auth** — Pre-shared key over TLS 1.3.
- **DNS override** — Prevents DNS leaks. Uses `resolvectl` on systemd-resolved systems, falls back to resolv.conf.


## Key Use Cases

**Stream bonding** — live feeds (SRT, RTMP) where a single connection does not provide sufficient bandwidth. The video at the top of this page shows an 8 Mbps SRT stream carried over two 6 Mbit uplinks; details in [Benchmarks](#benchmarks). RTMP, which cannot bond links on its own, bonds transparently through the tunnel — see [RTMP live streaming](#rtmp-live-streaming).

**Boosting general-purpose transfer** — not just video: bonding speeds up everyday traffic too. UDP and any other traffic is aggregated across paths over the datagram lane, and with [hybrid mode](#hybrid-mode-tcp-lane) TCP is aggregated as well — even a single TCP connection can use multiple paths at once. Details in [Benchmarks](#benchmarks).

**Staying connected on unreliable links** — when one connection drops or degrades (moving vehicles, congested Wi-Fi, cellular dead spots), traffic continues over the remaining paths without interrupting sessions.

## Installation

### Server

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn.git
cd mqvpn && ./build.sh

# Server
sudo scripts/start_server.sh
# → Generated auth key example: mPyVpoQWcp/5gr404xvS19aRC03o0XS2mrb2tZJ1Ii4=

# Client (single path)
sudo ./build/mqvpn --mode client --server 203.0.113.1:443 \
    --auth-key mPyVpoQWcp/5gr404xvS19aRC03o0XS2mrb2tZJ1Ii4= --insecure

# Client (multipath)
sudo ./build/mqvpn --mode client --server 203.0.113.1:443 \
    --auth-key mPyVpoQWcp/5gr404xvS19aRC03o0XS2mrb2tZJ1Ii4= --path eth0 --path wlan0 --insecure

# Client (multipath + backup failover path)
sudo ./build/mqvpn --mode client --server 203.0.113.1:443 \
    --auth-key mPyVpoQWcp/5gr404xvS19aRC03o0XS2mrb2tZJ1Ii4= --path eth0 --backup-path lte0 --insecure

# Client (with DNS override)
sudo ./build/mqvpn --mode client --server 203.0.113.1:443 \
    --auth-key mPyVpoQWcp/5gr404xvS19aRC03o0XS2mrb2tZJ1Ii4= --dns 1.1.1.1 --dns 8.8.8.8 --insecure

# Server (dual-stack — IPv4 + IPv6)
sudo scripts/start_server.sh --subnet 10.0.0.0/24 --subnet6 fd00:abcd::/112
```

This downloads the latest release, installs the binary, and generates a self-signed TLS certificate, auth key, and server config at `/etc/mqvpn/server.conf`. Add `--start` to start the server and register it for automatic startup on boot:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
    | sudo bash -s -- --start
```

> **Note:** The self-signed certificate requires `--insecure` on the client. For production, replace with a trusted certificate (e.g. Let's Encrypt) and omit `--insecure`.

Options can be combined:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
    | sudo bash -s -- --start --port 10020 --subnet 10.8.0.0/24
```

Uninstall: re-run the install script with `--uninstall`.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
    | sudo bash -s -- --uninstall
```

### Client (deb package)

Download the latest `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest):

```bash
# Replace VERSION and ARCH as needed (e.g., 0.6.0, amd64)
curl -LO https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest/download/mqvpn_VERSION_ARCH.deb
sudo dpkg -i mqvpn_*.deb
```

### Windows client

Pre-built binaries are shipped for Windows amd64 and arm64. Download `mqvpn_<VERSION>_windows_<ARCH>.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest), extract, and follow the bundled `README.txt` (admin PowerShell required).

### macOS client

Pre-built binaries are shipped for Apple silicon (arm64). Download `mqvpn_<VERSION>_darwin_arm64.tar.gz` from [Releases](https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn/releases/latest), extract, and follow the bundled `README.txt` (sudo required).

### Verifying downloads

Release artifacts carry [build provenance attestations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations)
signed via Sigstore. To verify a download was built by this repository's
release workflow:

```bash
gh attestation verify mqvpn_<VERSION>_<ARCH>.deb --owner mp0rta
```

A `SHA256SUMS` file is also attached to each release.

## Quick Start

After installing the server and client (see [Installation](#installation)):

```bash
# Client (single path)
sudo mqvpn --mode client --server YOUR_SERVER:443 \
    --auth-key YOUR_AUTH_KEY --insecure

# Client (multipath)
sudo mqvpn --mode client --server YOUR_SERVER:443 \
    --auth-key YOUR_AUTH_KEY --path eth0 --path wlan0 --insecure

# Client (with DNS override)
sudo mqvpn --mode client --server YOUR_SERVER:443 \
    --auth-key YOUR_AUTH_KEY --dns 1.1.1.1 --dns 8.8.8.8 --insecure
```

> **Notes:**
> - On Linux, without `--path`, the client uses the default interface (single path); multipath requires two or more `--path` flags. On Windows, `--path` is always required (one or more); see `docs/windows_build.md`.
> - The server needs its listen port open for UDP (default: 443). All client traffic is routed through the tunnel.

}
```

Notes:
- `users` is server-side auth and accepts either objects (`{"name","key"}` or `{"name","key","fixed_ip"}`) or `"name:key"` strings.
- A `fixed_ip` in a user object pins that IPv4 address to the user. The address is removed from the dynamic pool at startup and never assigned to other clients. The INI equivalent is `User = name:key:fixed_ip`.
- `routes` is a server-side list of IPv4/IPv6 networks reachable behind named clients. The INI equivalent is one repeated `[Route]` section per prefix. A route owner must exist under `users` and authenticate with that user's key; the legacy global `auth_key` plus a client-supplied `auth_username` cannot claim routed networks. Up to 512 prefixes can be configured without changing the existing 64-user limit. Exact duplicate prefixes for one owner are idempotent; exact conflicts are rejected, while nested prefixes use longest-prefix match. Routed prefixes must not overlap the tunnel address pool, and IPv6 routes require `subnet6`.
- `auth_key` remains supported as a single legacy/global key.
- `auth_username` is client-side only: the name sent to the server for identification in logs and status output. It does not affect authentication.
- `mode` is optional if it can be inferred (`listen` implies server).
- `manage_routes` defaults to `true`; set it to `false` on router/embedded integrations where an external orchestrator owns the host routing table and mqvpn should only bring up the TUN.
- `sync_path_labels` defaults to `true` and is meaningful on **both** client and server configs, each gating its own half of the sync (server: adopt; client: announce); see "Disabling weight/DSCP sync entirely" under [Schedulers](#schedulers) above.
- `path_policy` is server-only, JSON-only (no INI form): persisted per-(user,iface) `weight`/`dscp_mask` overrides, surviving a server restart or client reconnect. See "Persisting a server-side override" under [Schedulers](#schedulers) above.
- `push_path_labels` defaults to `false` and, like `sync_path_labels`, is meaningful on **both** client and server configs (server: push a pinned value; client: adopt one received) — but unlike `sync_path_labels`, both sides must opt in. See "Pushing a server-side override down to the client" under [Schedulers](#schedulers) above.
- **[mqvpn-prometheus-exporter](https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn-prometheus-exporter) requires per-user keys.** Using mqvpn-prometheus-exporter, you can correct and visualize mqvpn metrics. If you use it, sharing a single `auth_key` across
  multiple clients works for the VPN data plane, but the control API
  surfaces those sessions as `user="(global)"` and the Prometheus exporter
  cannot distinguish them — series labels collide and the scrape is
  dropped. For multi-client deployments register each client under `users`
  (or via `add_user` over the control API) so each gets a distinct `user`
  label.

```bash
sudo mqvpn --config /etc/mqvpn/server.conf
sudo mqvpn --config /etc/mqvpn/client.conf
```

### Native networks behind a client

`[Route]` selects the CONNECT-IP session for packets whose destination is a
network behind that client. The server also sends those prefixes to the
authenticated client as standard CONNECT-IP `ADDRESS_ASSIGN` entries, so the
client accepts forwarded LAN source addresses before Hybrid classification.
No extra IPIP encapsulation or matching route list in the client config is
needed.

The operating systems still perform the actual routing. For a routed IPv4
prefix, the deployment must:

- enable IP forwarding and permit the traffic in the `FORWARD` firewall chain
  on the client router;
- keep the LAN prefix reachable through the client's LAN interface and route
  the central networks through its mqvpn TUN;
- route the LAN prefix into `mqvpn0` on the server/central router (for example,
  `ip route add 10.50.0.0/16 dev mqvpn0`);
- provide a return route from the central network to the mqvpn server; and
- disable source NAT for this traffic and configure `rp_filter`/policy routing
  consistently with the chosen asymmetric or multipath layout.

LAN-initiated TCP remains eligible for `[Hybrid] Tcp = stream` because mqvpn
sees the original packet and 5-tuple. TCP initiated from the central side to a
LAN host continues to use the raw CONNECT-IP datagram lane by design. If the
LAN initiates Hybrid TCP toward an RFC1918 central network, add that central
CIDR to the server's repeated `[Hybrid] EgressAllow` list; the existing egress
ACL otherwise denies private destinations by default.

By default Hybrid TCP stream mode opens a connection with the server's source
address. To preserve the original LAN source IP and TCP port while retaining
H3 STREAM, enable `[Hybrid] Transparent = true` on both peers and configure
[Transparent Hybrid TCP return routing](docs/transparent-hybrid-tcp.md) on the
Linux server (IPv4). `Tcp = raw` or disabling Hybrid also preserves source
addresses through CONNECT-IP. Update both endpoints to this routed-network implementation;
older clients do not process the additional source prefixes.

## Schedulers

| Scheduler       | TCP              | UDP              | Typical use                                               |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `minrtt`        | min RTT          | min RTT          | latency-first                                             |
| `wlb` (default) | flow pin         | unpinned         | general use; UDP packets distributed per-packet           |
| `wlb_udp_pin`   | flow pin         | flow pin         | each UDP connection kept on a single path                 |
| `wrtt`          | weight × RTT     | weight × RTT     | weighted aggregation; RTT as tiebreaker when weights equal |
| `wrr`           | weighted RR      | weighted RR      | smooth weighted round robin, interleaved across paths      |
| `backup_fec`    | redundant        | redundant        | resilience-first (requires XQC_ENABLE_FEC)                |
| `redundant`     | broadcast        | broadcast        | every packet duplicated on every usable path; loss-critical, low-bitrate traffic |
| `dscp`          | DSCP policy route | DSCP policy route | route by inner packet's DSCP class to an assigned path, min-RTT fallback |

**Choosing wlb vs wlb_udp_pin:** Plain `wlb` distributes UDP packets across
paths per-packet, which gives better aggregate throughput when the inner
protocol tolerates reorder. Some inner UDP protocols, however, maintain their
own packet ordering and may treat reorder as packet loss — under asymmetric-RTT
paths this can slow them down and throughput drops. `wlb_udp_pin` keeps each
UDP connection on a single path to avoid that case. If you observe degraded UDP
throughput under `wlb`, try `wlb_udp_pin`; otherwise `wlb` is the better
default.

**Trade-off note (`wlb_udp_pin`):** the xquic WLB flow table is a fixed 4096-entry
open-addressed structure with 60s idle eviction. Workloads with very high
short-flow UDP churn (e.g. high-rate DNS, mDNS bursts) may evict longer-lived
inner flows under probe-region pressure. `wlb_udp_pin` is intended for tunnels
carrying a small-to-moderate set of long-lived inner UDP flows; high-churn UDP
profiles are better served by `wlb`.

**`wrtt` — weighted RTT scheduler:** each packet is sent on the path with the
best weight-to-RTT score. When weights are equal, the lowest-RTT path leads.
When weights differ, the higher-weight path dominates even if its RTT is worse.
When the preferred path is congestion-limited, traffic spills over to secondary
paths automatically (cwnd-block fallback). Path weights are set at runtime via
`set_path_weight` (see [Client commands](#client-commands) below). QUIC
multipath scheduling is per-endpoint-per-direction — the client and server
each schedule only the packets *they* send — but setting a weight on the
**client** is enough on its own: the client tells the server its own weight
for that path (piggybacked on the same mechanism that makes this survive a
reconnect — see the note under [Set path weight](#set-path-weight) below),
and the server adopts it for its downlink scheduling too, with no separate
server-side call needed. Use the server-mode form of `set_path_weight` only
if you want the server to use a *different* weight than the client for that
path (asymmetric control) — that explicit choice always wins over whatever
the client reports. Use `wrtt` when you need fine-grained per-link
preference in addition to aggregation — for example, to prioritise a
high-bandwidth fibre link over a metered LTE backup while still drawing on
both under load.

**`redundant` — broadcast scheduler:** every packet is duplicated onto every
currently usable path (both AVAILABLE and STANDBY, unlike the other
schedulers' preference for AVAILABLE paths) instead of being split across
them, trading bandwidth for maximum loss resilience — as long as one copy
arrives, the data is delivered. There is no aggregation benefit and effective
throughput is capped at the slowest usable path's share of bandwidth. Intended
for low-bitrate, loss/latency-critical traffic (control channels, keepalives,
VoIP) rather than bulk transfer.

**`dscp` — DSCP policy-routing scheduler:** each path is assigned one or more
DSCP classes via `set_path_dscp_mask` (see [Client commands](#client-commands)
below); packets are then routed by the inner IP header's DSCP field (the
same field `iptables -t mangle -j DSCP --set-dscp` or a QoS-aware application
would set), analogous to `ip rule add fwmark N table T`. A packet tagged with
a class goes to whichever assigned path currently has the best RTT (min-RTT
breaks ties when a class is assigned to more than one path); untagged
packets (DSCP 0 — the default for most traffic) and any class with no
currently-usable assigned path fall back to plain MinRTT across every path
instead of stalling. Use `dscp` when different inner traffic classes need
deterministic path placement — for example, pinning VoIP/EF traffic to a
low-latency link while bulk transfer rides a separate high-bandwidth one.
As with `wrtt` above, setting the mask on the **client** is enough — it's
reported to the server and adopted for downlink scheduling automatically,
so e.g. for a file download (where the bulk of the data flows
server→client) the client-side mask alone *does* now determine which path
it arrives on. Use the server-mode form of `set_path_dscp_mask` only to
pin the server to a different mask than the client (asymmetric control).

**Disabling weight/DSCP sync entirely:** the client→server auto-adoption
described above (for both `wrtt` weights and `dscp` masks) can be turned off
with `--no-sync-path-labels` (or `[Multipath] SyncPathLabels = false` in INI /
`"sync_path_labels": false` in JSON config) — set on **either or both**
sides, since each endpoint only reads its own half of the flag:

- On the **server**: it stops auto-adopting the client's announced value —
  the server's downlink weight/dscp_mask must then be set independently via
  the server-mode form of `set_path_weight`/`set_path_dscp_mask` (or is left
  at scheduler default).
- On the **client**: it stops announcing its own value to the server at all
  (no PATH_LABEL capsule is sent), so `set_path_weight`/`set_path_dscp_mask`
  only ever affects the client's own uplink — a kill switch that's effective
  even if you don't control the server's setting.

Either side alone is enough to fully decouple that client's weight/dscp_mask
from the server's downlink. Use this when client and server are operated
independently and should never inherit each other's per-path tuning.

**Persisting a server-side override (`path_policy`):** the server-mode
`set_path_weight`/`set_path_dscp_mask` calls above only ever set a live,
in-process value — restart the server and it's gone. `path_policy` (server
JSON config only, no INI form) is the persisted equivalent: a list of
`{"user", "iface", "weight"?, "dscp_mask"?}` entries, applied the first time
that user's connection announces a PATH_LABEL for the matching `iface` (so it
survives both a server restart and a client reconnect, unlike the live
call). At least one of `weight`/`dscp_mask` must be given per entry; either
takes precedence over the client's own announced value for that iface, same
as an explicit `set_path_weight`/`set_path_dscp_mask` call — and, like that
call, only has an effect when the connection's `scheduler` is `wrr`, `wrtt`,
or `dscp` (`wlb`'s weights are computed automatically, not operator-set):

```json
{
    "scheduler": "wrr",
    "path_policy": [
        { "user": "alice", "iface": "wan1", "weight": 100 },
        { "user": "alice", "iface": "wan2", "weight": 50, "dscp_mask": 70368744177664 }
    ]
}
```

**Pushing a server-side override down to the client (`push_path_labels`):**
everything above flows client→server — a value only ever originates on the
client, or gets pinned on the server for that server's own downlink only.
`push_path_labels` closes the reverse direction: with it enabled, a
server-pinned weight/dscp_mask (from `path_policy` above, or a live
`set_path_weight`/`set_path_dscp_mask` `_by_iface` call) is also pushed down
to that user's client and adopted into the client's own uplink scheduling —
so an operator can set a per-user override once, on the server, and have it
take effect on **both** directions with no separate action on the router.
Off by default and, unlike `sync_path_labels`, needs **both** ends to opt in
before anything happens:

- On the **server**: whether it ever pushes a pinned value at all. Enable
  with `--push-path-labels` (or `[Multipath] PushPathLabels = true` in INI /
  `"push_path_labels": true` in JSON config).
- On the **client**: whether it adopts a value it receives — same flag/flags,
  set on the client's own config. A server pushing to a client that hasn't
  opted in is a silent no-op (dropped, logged at debug).

Only ever pushes a value an operator actually pinned; a value the server
merely adopted from that same client's own announcement is never echoed
back to it, so this cannot loop with `sync_path_labels`.

## Reorder buffer (datagram lane)

A single inner UDP/QUIC flow striped across paths with different RTTs arrives
reordered, and many inner protocols treat reorder as loss and back off. The
reorder buffer holds datagrams in a short receive-side window and releases them
in order, so one inner flow can aggregate both paths — the datagram-lane
counterpart to what the [hybrid TCP stream lane](#hybrid-mode-tcp-lane) does for
TCP. Off by default; negotiated end-to-end (both client and server must enable
it) and a no-op when either side has it off.

```ini
[Reorder]
Enabled = on
MaxWaitMs = 50           # reorder window: hold out-of-order datagrams up to this long
CapPackets = 1024        # per-flow buffer cap (packets)

# Optional: target specific inner flows with a tuned preset
[ReorderRule]
Proto = udp
Port = 443
Profile = cellular_bond  # cellular_bond (wait=50ms, cap=1024) | fiber_lte (wait=50ms, cap=2048)
```

INI/JSON only (no CLI flag). Best on asymmetric-RTT path pairs (e.g. Wi-Fi +
LTE); for symmetric, loss-dominated paths leave it off. See
[docs/report/](docs/report/) for the parameter sweep and measured numbers.

## Reinjection (speculative duplication)

Sends copies of selected packets over a second link. This costs some extra
bandwidth, and in return the tunnel rides out packet loss and sudden link
trouble much more smoothly. Off by default. Sender-side only — each side's setting
protects the traffic it *sends*, so set it on the **server** to protect
download traffic (and on the client for upload). Requires multipath with two
or more active paths — silently inactive with only one.

```ini
[Multipath]
Reinjection = off                     # off (default) | deadline | idle | dgram
ReinjectionSrttFactorPct = 110        # deadline mode: duplicate an unacked packet older than factor x min_srtt (100-1000; 110 = 1.1x)
ReinjectionHardDeadlineMs = 500       # deadline mode: upper clamp (1-60000)
ReinjectionDeadlineLowerBoundMs = 20  # deadline mode: lower clamp (1-60000; clamped down to the hard deadline if it would exceed it)
```

- `deadline` — insurance for bonded tunnels running the [hybrid TCP lane](#hybrid-mode-tcp-lane). Most of the time it does nothing and costs nothing. When a link suddenly goes bad, data already sent on it must be recovered before in-order delivery lets anything behind it through — even data that already arrived via the healthy link — which in bad cases stalls transfers for up to a second; `deadline` resends the late data on the healthy link right away, shrinking that stall to a barely noticeable blip. Protects stream (TCP-lane) traffic only — with the hybrid lane disabled its effect is limited to control streams and a warning is logged. Protects TCP/stream traffic only — with the hybrid lane disabled its effect is limited to control streams and a warning is logged.
- `idle` — low-cost smoothing for interactive use (SSH, browsing): whenever the tunnel has nothing else to send, it uses that spare moment to send a copy of recent still-unconfirmed data over another link, shaving off occasional hiccups. No tuning needed.
- `dgram` — for tunnels dedicated to real-time traffic (VoIP, gaming): every datagram-lane packet (UDP and other non-TCP traffic; hybrid-mode TCP is not duplicated) is sent over two links at once, so a lost packet or a dying link no longer causes dropouts or lag spikes. **Uses double the bandwidth for that traffic; not recommended for mixed tunnels** — it duplicates all inner UDP, including HTTP/3 video streams, so the usable speed of the datagram lane drops to a single link's capacity. Duplicates are delivered twice at the receiver's TUN unless the [reorder buffer](#reorder-buffer-datagram-lane) is enabled (it removes them); plain UDP apps may otherwise see duplicate packets.

Per-path duplicated bytes are reported as `reinject_tx_bytes` in the control
API `get_status` response.

## Hybrid mode (TCP lane)

Optionally terminates inner TCP connections locally (embedded lwIP) and relays them over a dedicated HTTP/3 request stream instead of the datagram CONNECT-IP path — trades small per-flow overhead for multipath TCP aggregation (see docs/report/ for measured numbers).

```
TUN packet
  │
  ▼
classifier (per packet: protocol + Tcp mode + tunnel-subnet carve-out)
  │
  ├─ TCP, Tcp=stream (or Tcp=auto with ≥2 active paths)
  │     └─▶ tcp lane (client-side lwIP) ─▶ HTTP/3 request stream ─▶ server egress connect()
  ├─ UDP (parseable)
  │     └─▶ datagram lane (existing reorder/STAMP path) ─▶ CONNECT-IP DATAGRAM
  └─ everything else (incl. TCP under Tcp=raw, or Tcp=auto with <2 active paths)
        └─▶ raw lane (existing, unchanged) ─▶ CONNECT-IP DATAGRAM
```

```ini
[Hybrid]
Enabled = true
Tcp = auto              # stream | raw | auto (per-flow: TCP lane once >=2 paths are active)
TcpMaxFlows = 256        # concurrent TCP-lane flow cap (client, up to 4096) / per-session cap (server)
EgressAllow = 10.0.5.0/24  # server: punch a hole through the default-deny egress ACL
```

Disabled by default; existing users see no behavior change. See
[docs/control-api.md §9](docs/control-api.md#9-hybrid-mode-configuration-keys)
for the full `[Hybrid]` config key reference and the `get_stats` counters
this mode exposes.

## systemd

```bash
# Server
sudo cp /etc/mqvpn/server.conf.example /etc/mqvpn/server.conf
sudo vi /etc/mqvpn/server.conf   # edit cert/key paths, auth key, etc.
sudo systemctl enable --now mqvpn-server

# Client (template — instance name maps to config file)
sudo cp /etc/mqvpn/client.conf.example /etc/mqvpn/client-home.conf
sudo vi /etc/mqvpn/client-home.conf   # edit server address, auth key, etc.
sudo systemctl enable --now mqvpn-client@home
```

## Control API

Both the server and the client can be managed at runtime over a TCP port using newline-delimited JSON.

Control API: see [docs/control-api.md](docs/control-api.md) for the full wire-protocol reference (every command, request/response schemas, error strings). `get_stats`/`get_status`/`get_build_info`/`get_fec_stats`/`get_all_fec_stats`/`get_reorder_stats` all work in client mode as well as server mode.

### Enable

The control API is **disabled by default**. Enable it via any of the following:

#### From `install.sh`

```bash
sudo bash install.sh --enable-control            # port 9090
sudo bash install.sh --enable-control 9091
```

#### From INI (`/etc/mqvpn/server.conf`)

```ini
[Control]
Listen = 127.0.0.1:9090
```

#### From JSON (`/etc/mqvpn/server.json`)

```json
{
  "control_listen": "127.0.0.1:9090"
}
```

#### From CLI (per-field override of the config file)

```bash
# Server — CLI
sudo mqvpn --mode server ... --control-port 9090

# Server — config file ([Control] section)
# Port = 9090
# Addr = 127.0.0.1

# Client — CLI
sudo mqvpn --mode client ... --control-port 9091

# Client — config file ([Control] section)
# Port = 9091
# Addr = 127.0.0.1
```

> **Security:** bind only to `127.0.0.1` (the default) unless the port is protected by a firewall or network policy. The control API has no authentication.

### Commands

#### Add a user

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"add_user","name":"carol","key":"carol-secret"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

Calling `add_user` with an existing name updates the key in place.

To add a user with a fixed (pinned) IP that is permanently reserved for that user:

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"add_user","name":"carol","key":"carol-secret","fixed_ip":"10.0.0.50"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```

#### Set or clear a fixed IP for a user

Assign a fixed IP to an existing user at runtime. The address is removed from the dynamic pool and reserved exclusively for that user from the next connection onward.

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"set_user_fixed_ip","name":"carol","fixed_ip":"10.0.0.50"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

Pass `"fixed_ip":""` to remove the reservation and return the address to the dynamic pool:

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"set_user_fixed_ip","name":"carol","fixed_ip":""}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```

#### Remove a user

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"remove_user","name":"carol"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

#### List users

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"list_users"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true,"users":["alice","bob"]}
```

#### Get stats

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"get_stats"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true,"n_clients":2,"bytes_tx":983040,"bytes_rx":458752}
```

#### Error response

```json
{"ok":false,"error":"user not found"}
```

### Client commands

`add_path`/`remove_path`/`list_paths` are client-only. `set_path_weight` and
`set_path_dscp_mask` below also have a server-mode form — see each
subsection.

#### Add a path

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"add_path","iface":"wlan0"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

To add a backup (failover-only) path:

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"add_path","iface":"lte0","backup":true}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
```

#### Remove a path

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"remove_path","iface":"wlan0"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

Removing the last remaining path is rejected with an error.

#### List paths

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"list_paths"}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
```
```json
{"ok":true,"paths":["eth0","wlan0"]}
```

#### Set path weight

Set the scheduler weight for a path. Only effective with the `wrtt` scheduler.
Higher weight directs more traffic to that path; when weights are equal, the
lowest-RTT path is preferred. Weight `0` resets to the default (equivalent to
`1`). Valid range: `0`–`65535`.

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"set_path_weight","iface":"eth0","weight":10}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

Example — prioritise `eth0` (fibre) over `wlan0` (WiFi) while keeping both active:

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"set_path_weight","iface":"eth0","weight":10}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
echo '{"cmd":"set_path_weight","iface":"wlan0","weight":1}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
```

> **Note:** weights take effect once each path has completed its QUIC
> PATH_CHALLENGE/RESPONSE handshake and reached the `active` state. Calling
> `set_path_weight` before paths are active is accepted but the weight is applied
> as soon as the path activates.

**This is enough on its own — no server-side call needed.** QUIC multipath
scheduling is per-endpoint-per-direction (client and server each schedule
only the packets *they* send), but the client reports its own weight to the
server automatically, over the tunnel, every time it sets or (re)activates
a path — and by default the server adopts it for its own downlink
scheduling on that same path too. So setting `set_path_weight` on the
client, as above, biases *both* directions.

If you want the server to use a **different** weight than the client for a
given path (asymmetric control), call `set_path_weight` in server mode
instead — this always overrides whatever the client reports, from then on:

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"set_path_weight","user":"alice","iface":"wlan0","weight":10}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

The server has no local-interface concept for a path, so the server-mode
form takes either `iface` (the same name the client uses) or the raw
`path_id` (get the current value from [`get_status`](#commands)); `iface`
takes priority if both are given, and can be issued before that path has
even come up. Both forms — the client's own report and an operator's
explicit override — **persist across a path reconnect** (survive path_id
changing, which happens on every full teardown/recreate — xquic never
reuses an abandoned path_id): the underlying mechanism is a PATH_LABEL
capsule the client sends on the existing CONNECT-IP stream announcing
"path_id N is my iface I, with this weight/dscp_mask" every time it
(re)activates a path. It's additive and backward-compatible — an older
peer on either end just never sends/recognizes it, falling back to the
one-shot `path_id` form with no auto-mirroring. Scoped to one connection's
lifetime like the rest of a live session; a full reconnect (new QUIC
connection) starts it over on both sides, same as the client's own path
weights would if its process restarted.

#### Set path DSCP mask

Set the DSCP scheduler class bitmask for a path. Only effective with the
`dscp` scheduler. `dscp_mask` is a bitmask where bit *N* means the path may
carry DSCP class *N* (build it as `1 << dscp_class`, OR'd together for
multiple classes — e.g. `1 << 46` for EF alone). Mask `0` (the default)
assigns no dedicated class; the path still carries fallback MinRTT traffic.
Accepts decimal or `0x`-prefixed hex.

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"set_path_dscp_mask","iface":"eth0","dscp_mask":70368744177664}' | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

Example — pin EF (46, e.g. VoIP) to `eth0` and AF41 (34, e.g. video) to `wlan0`,
both computed as `1 << class`:

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"set_path_dscp_mask","iface":"eth0","dscp_mask":0x400000000000}'  | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
echo '{"cmd":"set_path_dscp_mask","iface":"wlan0","dscp_mask":0x400000000}'    | nc 127.0.0.1 9091
```

Untagged traffic and any class assigned to a path that is currently down
still get delivered — they fall back to plain MinRTT across every usable
path rather than stalling. Same activation-timing note as `set_path_weight`
above applies.

**Same as `set_path_weight` above — this is enough on its own.** The
client reports its own mask to the server automatically, and the server
adopts it for downlink by default, so setting this on the client biases
both directions; no server-side call needed unless you want the server to
use a *different* mask (asymmetric control), via the same `iface`/`path_id`
server-mode form:

```bash
echo '{"cmd":"set_path_dscp_mask","user":"alice","iface":"wlan0","dscp_mask":0x400000000000}' \
    | nc 127.0.0.1 9090
```
```json
{"ok":true}
```

Same priority (`iface` over `path_id` if both given) and persistence
behavior as `set_path_weight`'s server-mode form above.

### From code (Python example)

## Benchmarks

Asymmetric dual-path (300M/10ms + 80M/30ms) via network namespaces. Full report: [`docs/benchmarks_netns.md`](docs/benchmarks_netns.md)

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Failover | **0 downtime** |
| Bandwidth aggregation (WLB, 16 streams) | **319 Mbps** (84% of 380 Mbps theoretical) |
| WLB vs MinRTT | WLB **+21%** |

### Hybrid TCP-lane (v0.9.0)

Symmetric 2×100 Mbit / 25 ms, TCP uplink, `iperf3 -P {1,2,4,8,16}`, 3 reps. The hybrid TCP **stream lane** terminates TCP at the client and relays it in-order over a QUIC STREAM, so even a single flow aggregates both paths — where raw multipath (datagram tunneling) makes one flow back off on cross-path reorder. Hybrid ON reaches **~187 Mbps** (≈93 % of the 200 Mbps aggregate) at *every* stream count:

| WLB, streams (`-P`) | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| hybrid OFF (raw) | 96 | 177 | 167 | 177 | 178 |
| hybrid ON (lane) | **187** | 186 | 188 | 188 | 188 |
| gain | **+95 %** | +5 % | +12 % | +6 % | +6 % |

**Asymmetric paths** — same bench on the asymmetric pair (A = 300 Mbit / 10 ms + B = 80 Mbit / 30 ms, 380 Mbps aggregate). Hybrid ON saturates the aggregate (**350–356 Mbps** ≈ 93 % at `-P ≥ 2`) here too, while raw multipath never fully recovers: the cross-path reorder penalty (20 ms vs 60 ms RTT legs) caps it at 330 Mbps even at 16 streams — so unlike the symmetric case, raw multipath needs many parallel streams to close the gap:

| WLB, streams (`-P`) | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| hybrid OFF (raw) | 261 | 271 | 314 | 317 | 330 |
| hybrid ON (lane) | **327** | 350 | 354 | 356 | 354 |
| gain | **+26 %** | +29 % | +13 % | +12 % | +7 % |

### SRT live streaming

SRT contribution feeds over mqvpn, netns-emulated impaired links, mqvpn defaults (WLB, BBRv2) + SRT `lossmaxttl=32`. The starved-uplinks comparison video is shown at the top of this page; per-scenario results:

| Scenario | Direct (single link) | mqvpn (2-path) |
|---|---|---|
| Starved uplinks (8 Mbps FHD over 2 × 6 Mbit) | VMAF 8.6, 1.2 s frozen | VMAF **87.7**, 0 s frozen |
| Exceeds any single link (120 Mbps over 2 × 100 Mbit) | 31.5 % stream loss | **0.06 %** stream loss |
| Dual cellular (42 Mbps over 40 + 30 Mbit lossy links) | 20–40 % stream loss | **0.9 %** stream loss |

### RTMP live streaming

RTMP runs over a single TCP connection and cannot bond links by itself (commercial bonding products work around this with proprietary protocols and cloud-side conversion). Through mqvpn's [hybrid TCP lane](#hybrid-mode-tcp-lane) it bonds transparently — the encoder and the streaming service stay unmodified. Below, one of two bonded links is cut for 30 seconds mid-stream: direct (left) stops for ~33 s, mqvpn (right) never stops:

| Scenario | Direct (single link) | mqvpn (2-path) |
|---|---|---|
| Two weak uplinks (8 Mbps over 2 × 6 Mbit) | capped at 5.7 Mbps, drifts behind live | **7.8 Mbps, stays live** |
| Bursty mobile-style loss | repeated disconnects, barely delivers | **stable, no disconnects** |
| One link cut for 30 s | stream drops until the link returns | **keeps streaming** |

## Building

Requirements: Linux, CMake 3.10+, GCC/Clang (C11), libevent 2.x

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mp0rta/mqvpn.git
cd mqvpn
./build.sh            # builds BoringSSL, xquic, and mqvpn
./build.sh --clean    # full rebuild
```

<details>
<summary>Manual build steps</summary>

```bash
# 1. Build BoringSSL
# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is required — BoringSSL has no default build type, and
# omitting it produces an unoptimized library (~21% less VPN throughput).
cd third_party/xquic/third_party/boringssl
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=0 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-fPIC" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fPIC" ..
make -j$(nproc) ssl crypto
cd ../../../../..

# 2. Build xquic
cd third_party/xquic
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSSL_TYPE=boringssl \
      -DSSL_PATH=../third_party/boringssl \
      -DXQC_ENABLE_BBR2=ON \
      -DXQC_ENABLE_FEC=ON \
      -DXQC_ENABLE_XOR=ON ..
make -j$(nproc)
cd ../../..

# 3. Build mqvpn
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DXQUIC_BUILD_DIR=../third_party/xquic/build ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

</details>

### Android SDK

```bash
scripts/build_android.sh --abi arm64-v8a    # cross-compile C libs
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug       # build SDK + demo app
```

<details>
<summary>Module structure</summary>

```
android/
├── sdk-native/    # JNI bridge → libmqvpn_jni.so
├── sdk-runtime/   # MqvpnPoller (tick-loop)
├── sdk-network/   # NetworkMonitor, PathBinder
├── sdk-core/      # MqvpnVpnService, MqvpnManager, TunnelBridge
└── app/           # Demo app (Jetpack Compose)
```
</details>

## Testing

```bash
cd build && ctest --output-on-failure       # C library unit tests
sudo scripts/ci_e2e/run_test.sh             # E2E (netns, requires root)
sudo scripts/run_multipath_test.sh          # multipath failover
cd android && ./gradlew test                # Android SDK unit tests
```
